**Luminar** is a 3D rendering engine written in C++ using the SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) library. It focuses on rasterization techniques to render 3D objects on a 2D screen. Below is an overview of its key features and components.

## Key Features

- **High-Resolution Rendering**: Supports customizable screen dimensions for high-resolution rendering.
- **Depth Buffering**: Implements depth buffering to handle occlusion and ensure correct rendering of overlapping objects.

- **Customizable Camera**: Flexible camera setup allowing for various perspectives and transformations.
- **Efficient Rasterization**: Utilizes efficient rasterization techniques for rendering 3D meshes.
